- If your cottage cheese is very wet, drain it through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth to remove excess moisture. You want the cottage cheese to be relatively dry.
- In a mixing bowl, combine the drained cottage cheese, egg, flour, sugar, vanilla extract (if using), and a pinch of salt. Mix until well combined. The mixture should be thick and cohesive.
- Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease it with vegetable oil.
Using a spoon or your hands, form small pancakes (about 2-3 inches in diameter) from the cottage cheese mixture and place them on the skillet. Flatten them slightly with the back of the spoon or your fingers.
- Fry the syrniki for 2-3 minutes on each side, or until they are golden brown and cooked through. Adjust the heat as needed to prevent burning.
- Once cooked, transfer the syrniki to a plate lined with paper towels to drain any excess oil.
Serve the syrniki hot, topped with sour cream, jam, honey, or powdered sugar, according to your preference.
