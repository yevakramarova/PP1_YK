- Add about a gallon of water to a large pot. Bring it to boil. Meanwhile, remove the cabbage core using a sharp knife. Place a whole cabbage carefully in a pot with boiling water and let it cook for about 5 minutes. Flip the cabbage on the other side and cook for another 5 minute. Carefully remove the cabbage, let it cool down and separate it by leaves.
- Shred the carrots and dice the onion. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil. Add diced onion and cook for about 4 minutes stirring often. Add shredded carrots and saute for another 4-5 minutes or until the carrots are soft. Reserve half of the carrots and onions on the side, while keeping the rest in the skillet keeping the heat on low. Add 1 cup of tomato sauce and 3 Tablespoons of sour cream to the skillet. Stir and bring it to a gentle boil. Remove from heat.
- In a large mixing bowl, add 1 lb ground beef, ½ cup uncooked rinsed rice, reserved carrots and onions, ½ teaspoon salt, dried parsley, garlic powder, black pepper. Mix well to combine.
- Lay the cabbage leaf flat on a cutting board facing the stem down. Take a spoonful of your meat filling and place it near the bottom of the cabbage leaf, leaving a bit of space at the edges. Roll the bottom edge of the cabbage leaf up and over the filling, tucking it tightly. Now fold in the sides over the feeling. While keeping the sides folded, roll the cabbage roll all the way up. Place it in the pot with the seam facing down. Repeat with the rest of the meat filling and cabbage, arranging the rolls in layers.
- Spread the creamy tomato sauce on top of the rolls. Add few bay leaves. Pour enough water to cover the rolls. Cover the pot with a tight lid and bring it to boil. Reduce the heat to low and simmer for about 1 hour or until the rice is fully cooked. Serve with chopped dill and a dollop of sour cream.
