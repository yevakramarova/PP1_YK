- Place each chicken breast between two sheets of plastic wrap.
Use a meat mallet or rolling pin to pound the chicken to an even thickness, about 1/2 inch thick.- In a small bowl, mix together the softened butter, minced garlic, chopped parsley, dill, chives, salt, and black pepper until well combined.
Divide the herb butter into 4 equal portions.
- Place one portion of the herb butter in the center of each chicken breast.
Fold the sides of the chicken breast over the butter to enclose it completely. Press the edges firmly to seal.
- Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with breadcrumbs.
Dip each stuffed chicken breast first in the flour, shaking off any excess, then in the beaten eggs, and finally in the breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere.
- Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
Carefully add the breaded chicken breasts to the hot oil, working in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan.
Fry the chicken for 5-6 minutes on each side, or until golden brown and cooked through. The internal temperature should reach 165°F (75°C).
Remove the chicken from the skillet and drain on a paper towel-lined plate.
- Serve the Chicken Kyiv hot, garnished with lemon wedges for squeezing over the top.
Accompany with your choice of side dishes, such as mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.
