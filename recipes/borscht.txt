- Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat the oven to 400ÂºF. Halve and thinly slice 1 large yellow onion (about 2 cups). Trim off any large pieces of fat from 1 pound boneless beef chuck roast, then cut into rough 1-inch pieces (no need to cut stew meat). Season the beef with 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt.
- Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the beef in a single layer and sear until browned all over, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.
- Reduce the heat to medium. Add the onion and cook, scraping up the brown bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon, until golden brown and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add 1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste and cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomato paste is slightly darkened, 2 to 4 minutes.
- Return the beef and any accumulated juices to the pot. Add 2 (32-ounce) cartons low-sodium vegetable or chicken broth and 2 dried bay leaves. Scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Simmer until the beef is tender, about 1 hour.
- Meanwhile, peel and cut 1 1/4 pounds loose red beets into 3/4-inch pieces (about 3 1/2 cups). Peel and dice 3 medium carrots (about 1 1/2 cups). Peel and dice 1 large russet potato (about 1 1/2 cups). Place on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil and season with the remaining 1 teaspoon kosher salt. Toss to combine and spread into an even layer. Roast until crisp-tender and browned in spots, about 30 minutes.
- Prepare the cabbage and toppings while the vegetables are roasting: Cut the core from 1/2 small red cabbage, then thinly slice (about 3 cups). Coarsely chop the leaves and tender stems from 1/2 medium bunch fresh dill. Dice 1/2 medium English cucumber if desired. Add 1 tablespoon prepared horseradish and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt to 1 (8-ounce) container sour cream and stir to combine if desired.
- Add the roasted vegetables, cabbage, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, and 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar to the pot and stir to combine. Simmer until the cabbage is tender and everything is bright red, about 15 minutes. Discard the bay leaves. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed. Top each serving with the cucumber, dill, and a dollop of the horseradish sour cream if desired.
